<h1>How to run project</h1>

<p>
run_me.py is sample of analysis transaction service. when you run this file some samples files will be read from inputs
    and their analysis results will be written in oututs directory.

</p>

<h2>
    Different Modules For analysing transactions
</h2>

<h3>
    operations
</h3>
<p>
    Required operations to analyze transactions are in this module
</p>

<h3>
    readers
</h3>
<p>
    Different reading strategies for different file extensions are in this module. <br />
    read_file function is out public API which finds appropriate reader and return the result of reading.
</p>

<p>
    This module has just 1 function for getting info of given IP from geoip DB.
</p>

<h3>
    client
</h3>

<p>
    This module has just 1 function for getting info of ip from webservicex webservice.
</p>

<h2>
    Web based uasge
</h2>

<p>
    You can see your geography information on : / <br/>
    This request will call ws_client.views.ShowIPView.get method. This method finds your IP if you are behind a NAT will read your IP from X-Forward-For header and
    send a request to webservicex webservice. You can see the result on your screen :)

</p>

<h2>
    Webservice usage
</h2>

<p>
    I designed a rest-API for serving required functionalities as webservice.
    At first you need to send a GET request to /service/login/{username}/{password}
    Currently there are some sample username and passwords which you can use to login:
<ul>
    <li>
        Username: soroosh Password: sarabadani
    </li>
    <li>
        Username: user1 Password: pass1
    </li>
</ul>
You request will send to ws_client.views.LoginView.get method. This controller will check your username and password then will
create a session_id only if your username and password are correct. A JSON data you will receive in below format:
<br/>

<div class="code">
    {"result": "OK", "session_id": session_id}
</div>
If username and password are not correct the result is ilike:
<div class="code">
    {"result": "ERROR", "reason": error_message}
</div>

After getting your session_id you can send your request for getting ip to country service to: /service/ip/{session_id}/{ip_address}
<br/>
If session_id is not expired and ip is valid then you will get a response like:
<div class="code">
    {"result": "OK", "country_name": country_name}
</div>

If not the response will be like:
<div class="code">
    {"result": "ERROR", "reason": error_message}
</div>

<b class="alert">
    Note: The session timeout will be refreshed on every ip request. But if you don't send request for 10 minutes with a specific session_id
    your session will be expired.
</b>

<b class="alert">Note: you can see relation between urls and views(controllers) in Question4.urls.py</b>
